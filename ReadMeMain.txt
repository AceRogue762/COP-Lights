1. The first animation consists of two colors swapping halves of the light strip while series of flashes occur quickly between animations *red and blue with white flahes in this case.
2. The second animation consists of three total colors, one starts at each end of the light strip while the third is centered and given its own function. The end lights move pixel by pixel to the median while the third color in the median moves pixel by pixel in both outward directions to meet the other two *Red and Blue on the outsides to meet White in the median.
3. The third animation consists of a fadeinfadeout based animation with two main colors that loop through the animation quickly to give a flashing look, while a third and or fourth color are animated for an extremely short period of time to give the effect of a sub flashing color *Red and Blue are faded in and out quickly while the color white supplments as a third color istead of blacking out the pixels.
4. The fourth animation consists of an animation being sent to random pixels with a delay that is meant to look like rain and flashes of 'lightning' every so many animations.
